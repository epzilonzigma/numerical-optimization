# Numerical Optimization

This is my notes on studying numerical optimization. My objective is to not only be able to understand the algorithms used for training machine learning models but also understand how I can use optimization to optimize inputs based on any machine learning model.

## Outline

The following outline is tentative and may subject to change as I become more familiar with the subject matter.

1. Unconstrained Optimization
2. Gradient-free Optimization
3. Constrained Optimization
4. Optimization under Uncertainty
